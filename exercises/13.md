### Exercise 13

Let's now take a look at functions, they come in different flavours in javascript and by consequence in `typescript`

Let's explore them:

```ts
/**
 * Function
 */

export function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

export const addArrow: (x: number, y: number) => number = (x, y) => x + y;

export const addArrowTypeOnRight = (x: number, y: number): number => x + y;
```

The key differences is the default binding on `this`, basically the `this` of an arrow function is considered the `this` of the parent and the `this` of a classic `function` (called `named function`) is a new context.

This seems light but in reality the two are colossaly different, in general `function` is better performance wise and the `arrow` notation leads to less problems in classes (because classes are simulated via `function` with `this` as context).

We will talk about classes later during probably another day of the workshop in details and we will get back to this fundamental difference.

For now let's write a few functions and associated tests:

- sum
- mul
- sub
- div
- exp (using Math.pow)
