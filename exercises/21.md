### Exercise 21

The type `never` represents something that can never have a value, like the return type of a function that only throws an exception.

```ts
/**
 * Never
 */

// @ts-expect-error
export const myNever1: never = {};
// @ts-expect-error
export const myNever2: never = myFunction();
// @ts-expect-error
export const myNever3: never = myAny;

export function absurd(): never {
  throw new Error("absurd has been called");
}
```

Prove using tests that absurd throws an exception using:

```ts
try {
    code
} catch(e) {
    handle e
}
```

The interesting aspect of `never` (and `unknown`) is not it's specific usage but the behaviour when used with type unions (and by reflection for unknown on intersection)

We will explore those aspects a bit later
