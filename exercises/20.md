### Exercise 20

Null & Undefined are two representation of, again, absence of values (like one wasn't enough, but unfortunately javascript support is needed)

```ts
/**
 * Null & Undefined, twice the same concept...
 */
export const myNull: null = null;
export const myUndefined: undefined = undefined;

// @ts-expect-error
export const myUndefined2: undefined = null;
// @ts-expect-error
export const myUndefined3: null = undefined;
```

There's really not much to say on those types.
