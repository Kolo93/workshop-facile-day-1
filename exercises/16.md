### Exercise 16

Enums are a strange thing in typescript, usually typescript is supposed to not mix type definition and value definition, namely it never ever define values derived from types (the inverse is called inference and is a great feature in ts).

Enums compile down to a record of key => value where value is by default a number and can be reassined to be whatever you like.

Write some tests to assert the value of each case of the `Color` and `Color2` enums.

```ts
/**
 * Enum, considered risky
 */
export enum Color {
  Red,
  Blue,
  Green,
}

export enum Color2 {
  Red = "Red",
  Blue = "Blue",
  Green = "Green",
}

export const myBlue = Color.Blue;
```

We won't explore enums in details because union of literal types is a better alternative.
