## Exercise 15

Tuples are arrays of `known` lenght, before typescript `4.0` tuples were of `fixed` lenght, now they can be `variadic` so the lenght can be fixed or derived from a deterministic derivation.

We will explore those in more details when we will talk about conditional and distributive inference in the following days.

```ts
/**
 * Tuple
 */
export const myTuple: [string, string] = ["hello", "world"];
```

In the same way of arrays you can have a readonly tuple:

```ts
export const myReadonlyTuple: readonly [string, string] = ["hello", "world"];
```
