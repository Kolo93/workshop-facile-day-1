### Exercise 17

Unknown in typescript represent an `unknown` type, it means a value of a type that is not predefined.

```ts
/**
 * Unknown
 */
export const myUnknown: unknown = {};
export const myUnknown2: unknown = 1;
export const myUnknown3: unknown = "1";

// @ts-expect-error
export const myString: string = myUnknown3;
```

We can see that when we try to assign a value of `unknown` to something else we get a type error.

The correct way to deal with unknown values is to use type guards, let's see an example:

```ts
export function isString(u: unknown): u is string {
  return typeof u === "string";
}

if (isString(myUnknown)) {
  const y: string = myUnknown;

  console.log(y);
}
```

In this way we are forced by the static compiler to implement a runtime check.

### Unsafe casting

An `unknown` value can be `asserted` as any other value, for example:

```ts
const myStringFromUnknown: string = myUnknown as string;
```

Even being unsafe this sometimes turns out quite useful, the reason is in many cases in typescript you can write the type of a function such that your user can use it very smoothy but you can't get the compiler to actually consolidate pieces of the implementation where you are then forces to either disable check completely (bad idea, usually, kind of) or fix the unknown types by manual casting (so that you still have most of the implementation checked)
