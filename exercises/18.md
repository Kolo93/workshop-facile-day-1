### Exercise 18

The `any` type is a weaker form of `unknown` that is automatically assignable to everything:

```ts
/**
 * Any, considered harmful but necessary
 */
export const myAny: any = myUnknown;
export const myAny2: any = myUnknown2;
export const myAny3: any = myUnknown3;

// no error
export const myString2: string = myAny;
```

It is usually considered harmful because as you might imagine will lead to any sort of runtime bug
